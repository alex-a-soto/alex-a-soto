# Hi, Iâ€™m Alexander Soto ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a community organizer, educator, software engineer, hacktivist, and agent of social change. My interests are in exploring community-building, social justice, education, and leveraging technology to address social problems.

In the past, Iâ€™ve worked as a labor rights organizer, a teacher, and Iâ€™m currently the Project Lead at [EI2030](https://ei2030.org/), an Expert In Residence at [Resilient Coders](https://www.resilientcoders.org/), and founder of [Modos](https://www.modos.tech/).

I enjoy tinkering/playing/breaking things, 3D printing, painting, playing piano, swimming, and writing in my spare time.
